# eye_blink_detector
This package contains a modular pipeline of deep learning models to perform eye blink detection in real-time from a video stream. It is based on a face detector, which detects all the faces in the current frame. Only one is analyzed computing the segmentations of both eyes, which will be the input to the final blink classifier
